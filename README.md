# Jules PR Reviewer

A GitHub Action that uses [Google Jules](https://jules.google) (Gemini-powered cloud coding agent) to review pull requests and post the review as a PR comment. Optionally gates merges via a commit status check.

- Works on any language / framework — Jules is general-purpose.
- Low noise by default: aggressive false-positive filter baked into the prompt.
- Extensible: layer your own rules from the workflow or from a file in the repo.
- Per-PR comment with severity-tagged findings + a merge gate.

## What a review looks like

```
## Summary
Adds a /user lookup endpoint and an /admin check. Three critical security flaws need fixing before merge.

## Strengths
- Endpoint routing is clean and easy to follow.

## Findings
### [BLOCKING]
- `src/db.js`, line 4: SQL injection — the id parameter is interpolated into the query. Use parameterized queries.
- `src/server.js`, line 5: Hardcoded `sk_live_…` secret. Move to env var and rotate the token.
- `src/server.js`, line 18: Auth token passed via URL query string. Pass via Authorization header instead.

### [WARN]
- `src/server.js`, lines 12–14: No error handling around `getUserById`. Wrap in try/catch and return 500.

### [NIT]
- `src/db.js`, line 1: Unused `createConnection` import.

## Verdict
VERDICT: block
```

## Setup

### 1. Add your Jules API key as a repo secret

`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret`

- Name: `JULES_API_KEY`
- Value: key from [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com) (after authenticating with GitHub)

### 2. Add the workflow

`.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: Jules PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

concurrency:
  group: jules-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
      statuses: write
    steps:
      - uses: sanjay3290/jules-pr-reviewer@v1
        with:
          jules_api_key: ${{ secrets.JULES_API_KEY }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The `concurrency` block cancels an older review run when a new commit lands, preventing race conditions where a stale run's verdict overwrites a fresh one. **Recommended.**

### 3. (Optional) Gate merges on the review

`Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → Require status check → jules/review`.

Without this, a blocking verdict shows as a red X but won't stop merge.

## Customizing the review

Three ways to shape what Jules looks for (most → least common):

### A. Inline rules in the workflow

Best for quick tweaks or project-level rules.

```yaml
- uses: sanjay3290/jules-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    jules_api_key: ${{ secrets.JULES_API_KEY }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    extra_instructions: |
      Project is a Flutter mobile app.

      Additional blocking rules:
      - Any setState() call inside build() is BLOCKING.
      - Any hardcoded API URL (not read from Config) is BLOCKING.
      - Missing await on a returned Future is BLOCKING.

      Soft rules:
      - Prefer const constructors where possible — raise as NIT.
      - All public APIs must have dartdoc — raise as WARN.
```

### B. Rules file in the repo

Best when rules are long, evolving, or shared across workflows. Default path: `.github/jules-review-rules.md`.

```markdown
# Review rules for my-org/my-repo

## Always blocking
- Direct writes to `users.balance` without going through `account-service`.
- Any usage of `eval`, `Function(...)`, or `child_process.exec` with user input.

## Framework conventions
- React components must be functional (no class components).
- All API handlers must be wrapped in `withAuth()`.

## What to skip
- Tests are linted separately — don't review test files.
```

The action reads the file from the PR's head commit. Override the path with `rules_file:` or disable with `rules_file: ""`.

### C. Both

The workflow's `extra_instructions` is appended after the rules file content. Use the file for stable rules and the workflow for quick situational overrides.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `jules_api_key` | — | **Required.** Key from jules.google.com. |
| `github_token` | — | **Required.** `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. |
| `fail_on` | `blocking` | `never` \| `blocking` \| `any`. Controls commit-status state. |
| `skip_drafts` | `true` | Skip review on draft PRs. |
| `skip_forks` | `true` | Skip PRs from forks (diff can contain prompt-injection payloads). |
| `bypass_label` | `jules-override` | If the PR has this label, skip the review. |
| `status_context` | `jules/review` | Commit status context name. |
| `extra_instructions` | `''` | Markdown appended to the prompt. |
| `rules_file` | `.github/jules-review-rules.md` | Path in repo to load as extra rules. Set empty to disable. |

## Severity & verdict

Jules is instructed to tag findings:

- **[BLOCKING]** — high-confidence correctness/security flaws. Only used when Jules is >80% sure.
- **[WARN]** — meaningful concerns, non-blocking.
- **[NIT]** — small readability / consistency notes. Capped at 3 per review.

And end with a verdict line:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VERDICT: approve` | No blocking issues. |
| `VERDICT: comment` | Warnings or nits only. |
| `VERDICT: block` | One or more blocking issues. |

`fail_on` maps verdict → status:

| `fail_on` | approve | comment | block |
|---|---|---|---|
| `never` | success | success | success |
| `blocking` *(default)* | success | success | **failure** |
| `any` | success | **failure** | **failure** |

The **workflow job itself always passes** if the action ran successfully — the status check is what gates merge. Job failures indicate the action broke, not that the review found issues.

## Prerequisites

Your repo must be connected to your Jules account. After authenticating at jules.google.com with GitHub, the repos you authorize become available as sources. To verify, create a file `list-sources.mjs`:

```js
import { jules } from '@google/jules-sdk';
for await (const s of jules.sources()) {
  if (s.type === 'githubRepo') {
    console.log(`${s.githubRepo.owner}/${s.githubRepo.repo}`);
  }
}
```

Then run: `JULES_API_KEY=... node list-sources.mjs`

## Security

- **Only `pull_request` is supported.** `pull_request_target` is rejected — it runs with base-repo write tokens, and exposes the action to prompt-injection via attacker-controlled diffs.
- **Fork PRs are skipped by default** (`skip_forks: true`). An untrusted fork's diff/PR description can contain prompt-injection payloads. The action's system prompt has defense-in-depth instructions telling Jules to ignore instructions embedded in untrusted content and flag them as blocking — but skipping forks is the safer default.
- **`rules_file` is loaded from the base SHA**, not the PR head. An attacker cannot change the review rules by editing them in their PR.
- **All untrusted content is fenced** in the prompt as "UNTRUSTED" with explicit instructions to Jules.
- **Failure modes are resilient**: if Jules times out, the API errors, or the action crashes, the commit status is set to `error` and the PR comment is updated with a failure note — merge isn't silently blocked by a stale `pending` check.

## Notes

- **Latency**: typical review is 40s–5min.
- **Cost**: each PR open/push creates one Jules session. Rate-limit via `bypass_label`, label-gated workflow triggers, or `paths:` filters.
- **Drafts**: skipped by default; mark `ready_for_review` to trigger.
- **Large diffs**: diff is truncated at 80 KB. When truncated, the prompt tells Jules its review may be incomplete.
